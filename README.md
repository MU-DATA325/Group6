Capital Bikeshare 

7 Cities w/ data:
Washington
Boston
Los Angeles 
New York
Chicago
Philadelphia
San Francisco

We can compare and contrast the Bikeshare data between each country by looking at different variables offered:

Usage differences per major city
Start times/Stop times
User Type (single trip/day pass, member (annual or monthly)
Gender (self reported)
Most used locations in each city 
Distance
Time

Can base the research question off of the theory above


#Section 1 Introduction: 

The idea of Bikeshare was created in Amsterdam, Netherlands in 1965 and didn't come to the United States until much later. Portland Oregon in 1994 adopted the first community bike project in the United States, but they really are only active in major cities. 
Currently they are being used in major cities, privately, and in universities for a cheaper more sustainable way to transport oneself. 

Data has been collected through member surveys, as well as documentation through apps when the information is taken by recipients electronically. 
Data was initially processed to track the system as well as remove trips that are taken by staff as they service or inspect the system. Also has a development plan survey every few years to assess usage trends and plans. 

For our research question we will be asking "Where can they expand to next?" Given the variables and cases, where is the next big city that Bikeshare could take there business? 


#Section 2 Data: 

So once we find the data we want to use we just have to import it to Github which will then allow us to bring it into Rstudio 

#Section 3: Data Analysis Plan:

We need to have 1 singular response variable y and we can have as many explanatory variables x as we want. So just have to divide that up.

-Our response variable will be the amount of revenue brought in from big cities

-Our predictors will be the amount of bikes that are available, the current population in each city, the location within each city, the time of year 

-the comparison groups: other bike companies? 

-

- the method(s) we will be using to answer our research questions will be
